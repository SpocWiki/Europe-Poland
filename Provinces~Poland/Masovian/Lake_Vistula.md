> **Włocławek Reservoir** (Polish: Zbiornik Włocławski) is a water body 
> in the Middle Vistula flow after building of the dam in Włocławek in 1970. 
> 
> The length of the reservoir is 58 km from Włocławek to Płock, 
> average width is 1.2 km. It is the biggest reservoir in Poland.
>
> Due to the significant amount of organic matter in the tank 
> (approx. 11.5% of the dry weight of sediment), 
> it emits approx. 400 mg/m²d of methane per day
> (which is approx. 27% of the total amount of gases 
> emitted from the sediment of average 3114 ml/m²d). 
> For this reason, is considered an important source of  greenhouse gases emission.
