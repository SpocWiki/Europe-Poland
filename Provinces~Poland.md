> A **Voivodeship** ( VOY-vohd-ship) or voivodate 
> is the area administered by a voivode (governor) 
> in several countries of central and eastern Europe. 
> 
> Voivodeships have existed since medieval times 
> and the area of extent of voivodeship 
> resembles that of a duchy in western medieval states, 
> much as the title of voivode was equivalent to that of a duke. 
> 
> Other roughly equivalent titles and areas in medieval Eastern Europe 
> included ban (bojan, vojin or bayan) and banate.
>
> In a modern context, 
> the word refers to one of the provinces (województwa) of Poland. 
> As of 2024, Poland has 16 voivodeships.
